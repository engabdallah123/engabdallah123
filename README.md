 ## 🚀 What I'm Passionate About (My Expertise):
 .NET Development (In Training): Strengthening my expertise in building robust and scalable backend solutions using ASP.NET Core. My focus includes clean architecture, RESTful API design, Entity Framework Core, and efficient database management with SQL Server. I continuously practice implementing authentication, authorization, and real-time communication using SignalR.

Angular Development: Creating dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web applications with Angular. I emphasize intuitive UI/UX design, modular architecture, and leveraging RxJS for state management and reactive programming. My workflow also integrates Bootstrap and Sass for scalable and maintainable styling.

Project-Driven Learning: I believe in "learning by building." I actively transform theoretical concepts into real-world projects, combining .NET and Angular to deliver full-stack applications. This hands-on approach sharpens my problem-solving skills and strengthens my ability to design, implement, and optimize end-to-end solutions.
